# linux-customised-terminal

The configurations I use are based off **Alh4zr3d's terminal setup** which he has kindly made public (here)[https://www.patreon.com/posts/how-to-get-my-77367710].

This repo consists of:
- ASCII Art which is referenced in my neofetch's configuration (feel free to replace with your own).
- Amended neofetch configuration file, to load the ascii art when called.
- A slightly amended `.zshrc` file which includes some custom aliases to make my life easier and ensure the programs that need to launch do so when the terminal is opened.

The tmux config I use is a clone from Alh4zr3d and only has directories changed to reflect my environment setup. For the sake of brevity it is not included here.
